# tate-skos
This repository features a [SKOS](https://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/) taxonomy generated from Tate's subject hierarchy through the use of Catalink's semantic data integration framework [CASPAR](https://caspar.catalink.eu/). 

## Scope & Aims
[Tate UK](https://www.tate.org.uk/) has publicly released its subject hierarchy as a [set of JSON files](https://github.com/tategallery/collection/tree/master/processed/subjects) organized in three levels. For example, in [this artwork](http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/blake-a-figure-bowing-before-a-seated-old-man-with-his-arm-outstretched-in-benediction-a00001) by Robert Blake, the relevant subjects are found in section 'Explore'. An excerpt from the specific subjects is `people > adults > man, old`. The aim of this work was to assess how easy it was to deploy our [CASPAR framework](https://caspar.catalink.eu/) for converting the set of JSON files into a SKOS taxonomy. The benefit of having the subject hierarchy in SKOS format is that it enables its easy publication and use by third parties as [linked data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_data).
